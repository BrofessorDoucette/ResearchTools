This repository is filled mostly with python scripts that I used for data analysis while I was a graduate student working with Professor Allison Jaynes. 

The case studies themselves were usually handled in jupyter notebooks while the heavy duty lifting was done in the source .py files and then imported into the notebooks. However, as always, slowly over time the repository has sort of degraded in quality and is probably in proper need of a refactoring. There are files in here for working with a machine learning model on an imbalanced dataset, simulating radial diffusion using the 1-D Fokker Planck equation, investigating alfven waves, and plotting radial phase space density profiles.

My favorite project I did in this repository was actually making the system to load data. The system for loading data in this repository is very OP for doing research.
